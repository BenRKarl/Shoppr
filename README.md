#Shoppr

###Shoppr is a small application built to explore the below technologies. These are also the app's dependencies:

* [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [jQGrid](http://www.trirand.com/blog/)

###Installation:

Clone this repo: 

`git clone https://github.com/BenRKarl/Shoppr.git`

From the command line, run:

`npm install`

Then:

`gulp`

The default Gulp task will kick up a server on localhost:3000 and listen for changes to the .less and .jsx files.
